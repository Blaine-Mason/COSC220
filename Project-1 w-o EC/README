Project 1

Welcome to the user guide for the Student Database project!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just in case, start out by running:
make clean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next you'll want to run:
./StudentDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unless you're Dr.Anderson, then run:
valgrind --leak-check=full ./StudentDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll see a menu that looks like this:
Welcome to Student Database
--------------------
|C.) Create Student|
--------------------
--------------------
|U.) Update Student|
--------------------
--------------------
|D.) Delete Student|
--------------------
--------------------
|E.) Exit          |
--------------------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
C) This command allows you to create a student and add it to the
   Database. The information you'll input will be the name, date
   of birth, and major. You'll be prompted to enter the courses
   taken, if no courses were taken, enter n. If you do have courses
   to add, enter y. You'll enter information about the course like the
   name, department, semester, and grade. After that you'll be prompted
   the menu again.
U) This command allows you to edit information about a student already
   in the Database. You'll be prompted for the name of the student you would
   like to edit, then information will be displayed about the student so
   you know what can be edited. Entering -1 exits the update, if you choose
   to update a course, you can add or remove it. When removing it's important
   to know you start with 0. After entering -1, you'll be prompted with the
   menu again
D) This command allows you to delete a student from the Database. You'll have the
   database printed out, and you can enter the name of the student to be deleted.
   After deleting a student you will be displayed the menu again.
E) Exits the program, and since I did not do the extra credit, all the work you
   just did on the database will be deleted from the heap...(hopefully).

Here is a sample output:
